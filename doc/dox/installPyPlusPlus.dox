/**
\page installPyPlusPlus Installation of Py++

<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/pygccxml/">Py++</a>
requires pygccxml and GCC-XML. You need the versions of GCC-XML,
pygccxml, and Py++ that are taken directly from their respective
repositories. Directions for installing GCC-XML can be found <a
href="http://www.gccxml.org/HTML/Download.html">here</a>, and for
installing pygccxml/Py++ they can be found <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/scm/?type=svn&group_id=118209">here</a>.
The combined set of instructions is included in the script
ompl/src/external/installPyPlusPlus.sh. This script will also
apply a patch to pygccxml that is necessary to prevent it from
treating gccxml warnings as errors. You can run this script (after
running cmake) like so:
\code
make installpyplusplus
\endcode
The script will ask for your password so that it can install
these programs. If the script completes successfully, run cmake
again and you should be able to generate the Python bindings by
typing “make update_bindings”.


If you are using OS X and MacPorts, it is recommended you install Py++ like so:
\code
sudo port selfupdate
sudo port install py27-pyplusplus-devel
\endcode
