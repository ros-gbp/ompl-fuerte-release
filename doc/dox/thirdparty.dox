\page thirdparty Third-Party Contributions


This page includes a list of extensions to OMPL provided by the community. The contributed code can be found under the \c ompl/src/ompl/contrib directory in the OMPL source code. The contributed code has been written and tested by their respective authors listed below. Maintenance and support is also provided by the same authors. Please read the \ref contrib "directions on writing a contribution" and the suggested \ref styleGuide "style guide" if you would like to submit your own contribution.


\section ompl_ros_interface ROS Interface to OMPL

\subsection ompl_ros_author Author: Sachin Chitta (Willow Garage)
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.ros.org/wiki/ompl_ros_interface">ompl_ros_interface</a> ROS package wraps OMPL such that motion planners can be easily set up for your robot. Most configuration is automated. However, you will have to specify the parts of the robot for which you want to create a motion planner.

\section rrtstar_contrib RRT* and extensions

\subsection rrtstar_contrib_authors Authors: Alejandro Perez and Sertac Karaman (MIT)

<ul>
<li>
\ref gRRTstar "RRT*" (optimal \ref gRRT "RRT") is an asymptotically-optimal incremental sampling-based motion planning algorithm. RRT* algorithm is guaranteed to converge to an optimal solution, while its running time is guaranteed to be a constant factor of the running time of the RRT. The RRT* algorithm was introduced and analyzed in:
- S. Karaman and E. Frazzoli, <em>Sampling-based algorithms for optimal motion planning</em> Int. Journal of Robotics Research, 2011. To appear. Also available at <a hef="http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.1186">http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.1186</a>.
.
For more information on RRT* and its variants see <a href="http://ares.lids.mit.edu/rrtstar/">http://ares.lids.mit.edu/rrtstar/</a>.

<li>
\ref gBallTreeRRTstar "Ball Tree RRT*" is an implementation of RRT* that incorporates Ball Trees to approximate connected regions of free space with volumes in configuration space instead of points. Every vertex added to the tree has an initial volume of an infinite radius associated with it. This radius is gradually reduced as collisions are found. All samples within any of the existing volumes are discarded. However, discarded samples are collision checked. If a collision is found, the nearest volume is trimmed at the collision point. Information from all collision checking procedures within iterations is also used to trim volumes accordingly.
The Ball Tree RRT* was introduced in:
- A. Perez, S. Karaman, M. Walter, A. Shkolnik, E. Frazzoli, and S. Teller, <em>Asymptotically-optimal manipulation planning using incremental sampling-based algorithms,</em> in IEEE/RSJ Int. Conf. on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2011.

\section prm_contrib PRM extensions

\subsection prm_contrib_authors Author: James Marble (University of Nevada at Reno)
<ul>
<li>
Generalized the implementation of PRM so that different variations
can be created by passing connection strategies and filters. Provided
such functions for PRM and PRM*.
</li>
</ul>

\section rrt_ctrl_contrib RRT extension for planning with controls

\subsection rrt_ctrl_contrib_authors Author: Jennifer Barry (MIT)
<ul>
<li>
Generalized the implementation of RRT (with controls) so that
intermediate states generated along motions are also optionally added
to that tree of motions.
</li>
</ul>
