           @par Short description
           Implementation of \ref gRRTstar "RRT*" that incorporates Ball Trees
           to approximate connected regions of free space with volumes in
           configuration space instead of points. Every vertex added to the tree has an initial volume
           of an infinite radius associated with it. This radius is gradually reduced as collisions are found.
           All samples within any of the existing volumes are discarded. However, discarded samples are
           collision checked. If a collision is found, the nearest volume is trimmed at the collision point.
           Information from all collision checking procedures within iterations is also used to trim volumes
           accordingly. The radii of volumes are considered when computing nearest/near neighbors. This
           implementation is suited for high-dimensional planning problems with narrow collision boundary passages.
